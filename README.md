# CheatBook 🧠💻  
Welcome to **CheatBook**, the ultimate repository of personal cheatsheets collected and created by **Hx3R** while mastering the art of hacking and cybersecurity.

## 🕵️ About This Project  
As I learn, break, and build my way through the hacker mindset, this repo serves as my personal knowledge vault. Each cheatsheet is crafted from hands-on experience, tutorials, challenges, and tools I encounter along the way.

Whether you're a beginner, intermediate learner, or just curious—feel free to browse, use, and get inspired by the resources here.


## 💡 Why CheatBook?  
Because real learning comes from doing. This project is my attempt to document insights, commands, and workflows that I never want to forget—and that others might benefit from too.
